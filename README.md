The Safe Air Indoors Framework (SAIF) is born in March 2022 as a project to consolidate efforts towards moving forward to a new reality in which the virus causing COVID-19 and emerging variants or new airborne viruses are fought.

And that is, simply, the pursuit of accessing, providing and promoting better indoor air quality measures to prevent the spread of airborne viruses.

This is something any individual, by their own decision, can contribute to.

## Why Indoor Air Quality?

There is an overwhelming quantity of evidence that [#COVIDIsAirborne](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDisAirborne) and guidance from the scientific community and several health authorities shares constantly through appropriate channels.

Evidence on how we can minimize the risk of contagion if we reduce the exposure to air particles or aerosols containing the virus. In essence, we need to improve the circulation of clean air indoors to achieve this, we know outdoors are safe, we just need to make indoors as equally safe as possible.

Air quality is one of the best ways to reduce exposure to infection, and with vaccines it becomes a powerful combination that is broadly accessible.

In this space, I’ll share some links to learn about this fact.

## Why now?

Public policies to fight COVID-19 has proven to be inefficient, even though we are more than 2 years long into the pandemic as of this writing, policies to minimize the effect in mortality and [#LongCovid](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LongCovid) prevention has had mixed results.

With wrong restrictions like lockdowns instead of better contact tracing and isolation, or sometimes good policies like wearing face masks in public transport, those measures are more often than not, temporary and reactive. Hence, are targeted to control the hospitalizations more than adapting to a new way of living that is sustainable and safe, yet still reduce the risks and preserving people’s freedoms.

Secondly, not everyone in the world knows about the science behind good air quality and aerosol transmission, even though there has been plenty of information circulating and a lot of preaching. This is a way for the information to reach them through collective behavior changes, and so they can make their own decisions based on evidence and information and usage of scientific thinking.

And finally, lately the scientific and health community is being constantly accused of fearmongering and miss-information when speaking up and arguing about policies not based on science and evidence. This is dangerous for public health sustainability, it is crucial that we keep listening to the experts and assess new evidence as it becomes available if we want to live in a safe environment increasingly being threatened by new pathologies. This project is a way to honor their voices and amplify their message.

## How would any of this help?

The SAIF intends to create a paradigm shift in the way we think and adapt as individuals in this pandemic and the next, by empowering and encouraging people to do what’s best for their safety and their family. 

Instead of pushing to have an impact on leadership and large-scale policies, we believe that each individual can enable change by doing small actions to contribute to build a safer environment. We can become an organized society that fights collectively and effectively the airborne deceases of today and the future.

For that, we require access to better indoor air quality, and by leveraging the data collected here or applying any good practice in your context helps to achieve this goal.

## Contributing to SAIF

The best way to contribute is through GitHub channels in the following way:

- Create a new Discussion to have information you find relevant included or changed in this Readme or in the upcoming site, all is subject to approval by administrators.
- You can add data for the SAM App by issuing a Pull Request to the datastore.csv file, the PR review is a quick look to attempt to verify validity of the data, more complex mechanisms may come later. Issue another PR to make adjustments to data too.
- Issues are only to be used to raise issues in the SAIF Map and App (upcoming)
- If you want to buy me a coffee to continue maintaining this project, please do so through here:
- Finally, share SAIF as much as possible and keep the checklist in mind.

## Framework tools

These are good practices and tools to help with implementing or accessing safe air indoors, the checklist, the data set and the map will be available in a first stage, and the app a bit later. 

### Safe Air Checklist

Being your place of work, school, business, public place or residence, this is a checklist of actions to consider to use to improve air safety indoors, not all are necessary or applicable depending on your context, but any measure contributes to the goal.

When raising a PR to include a new place that employs good air quality actions, this checklist will also be available to check.

- [ ]  Opening doors and windows and turn on available fans to allow air circulation
- [ ]  Monitoring CO2 levels to gauge air recycling in a room
- [ ]  Utilizing [Corsi-Rosenthal boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsi%E2%80%93Rosenthal_Box) or similar filtration systems to help filter aerosols

      - [Origin of the #CorsiRosenthalBox](https://twitter.com/CorsIAQ/status/1500748897034985474)
- [ ]  Using MERV 14 / ISO ePM1 70-80% or higher filters in HVAC or similar air filtration devices
- [ ]  Wearing of high-grade masks (N95, KN95, FFP2 or similar) when appropriate
- [ ]  Monitoring and improving air humidity to help slow the spread of the virus (40-60 % RH)
    - Resources: [Relative humidity of 40-60% in buildings will reduce respiratory infections and save lives. - 40to60RH](https://40to60rh.com/)
- [ ]  Reducing number of people allowance in a room

### Safe Air Map Data

The purpose of this data set is to create a source of locations which can be businesses, work or public places, where any if not all of the Safe Air Checklist actions are implemented to provide safe air conditions to the people accessing them or doing business with them.

With this we encourage owners or managers to maintain such practices and helps other people find them easily

### Safe Air Map (SAM) App

Upcoming app using the Safe Air Map Data

At the moment I have set up a Google Map with the data imported from this repository.
